Purpose: With so many people panicked about a lack of materials, I feel like an app could definitely help with those issues. I’ve seen countless reports about people buying all of the toilet paper in stores, loading up on certain foods, and paying absurd amounts of money for hand sanitizers. My app will let people look up an item and then see what stores around them have it in stock. This will allow people to not waste their time traveling to certain stores, and it can relieve some stress this pandemic has caused. 
Features: The user should be able to type the item they want in the toolbar and the app should then drop a list of stores sorted by distances that have the item the user seeks. The user should be able to click on a store they want to go to and then receive a popup notification with the address to the store. The user should be able to delete the item in the toolbar and be able to type another item they want. The stores on the list should refresh once the user enters the name of their next item.
Challenges: It would be challenging to make it so the app knows the distance of every store that has the item in stock. Also, the app wouldn’t just measure grocery stores but convenience stores, gas stations, etc. It’s supposed to tell the user of every store that has it. It would also be challenging to make sure the app understands what the user is searching for. Another challenge is to get every store to use the app. It can only work if workers at the store are constantly keeping track of the quantities of items and then reporting it to the app. There must be an incentive for stores to report their items to the app.
