This app is a song playlist. 
You can add the title of any song with the plus button on the top left. 
You can also press the edit button on the top right of the application and then delete what ever song you want to remove from the playlist
The sort button that's located on the top left of the application sorts all of the songs based on their value. The songs must start with a capital letter though.
The app automatically saves for the most part because of the UserDefault class I used.
The only problem with the app is that it doesn't save the last thing you input for some reason.
  For example: if you added 3 songs, it'll only save the first 2 songs you added.
